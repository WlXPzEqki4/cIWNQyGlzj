1,Businessman charged for mega-consignment of cocaine seized in Germany,"After more than a year, the Public Prosecutor's Office decided to charge businessman Diego Isaac Benítez Ca√±ete, owner of Pinturas Tupa SA and former manager of the Olimpia club, with drug trafficking. March 17, 2022 10:13 am The Prosecutor's Office decided to charge businessman and former sports manager Diego Isaac Benítez Ca√±ete with possession, trafficking and sale of narcotic substances. His international arrest warrant was also ordered, since there is information that he is not in Paraguay. The Public Prosecutor's Office accuses the businessman of having carried out, in the months of December 2020 and February 2021, activities aimed at sending to Israel a shipment of 16,174 kilos of alleged cocaine, which was hidden in containers. The cargo was seized in the port of Hamburg, Germany, on February 12, 2021. According to the Public Prosecutor's Office, the accused allegedly used the company Pinturas Tupa SA, of which he is the president and main beneficiary, to export the drugs, under the guise of a shipment of pastes that were to be consigned to an Israeli company called Tambour Group. Benítez had even appeared before the Public Prosecutor's Office in March 2021, and told the media that 20 days before the raids he had already reported the incident to the authorities and that he continued to collaborate with the investigation. His lawyer, former prosecutor Hugo Volpe, had said that it was normal for organized crime structures to act in terms of infecting the most in-demand cargo. The Paraguayan Packaging Company SRL (Envapar), which includes the companies Pinturas Tupa SA and Cartorpar, issued a statement stating that Pinturas Tupa is a victim of transnational organized crime. ""An export of products destined for that country was altered during the sea journey and the German authorities confirmed that the containers that originally contained our brand products now contain 16,000 kilos of cocaine,"" the company had stated. The Public Prosecutor's Office and the Senad had also raided a warehouse linked to the case, where they found 17 drums containing chemical precursors used to make cocaine. The operation known as North Atlantic had begun with the simultaneous raids of companies and a home, as part of an investigation into the seizure of large volumes of cocaine in Hamburg and Belgium. However, it took more than a year for any new progress to be made in the case."
2,Diego Benitez was arrested eight days ago in the United Arab Emirates,"Former sports leader Diego Benítez, wanted for a large cocaine shipment, has been detained in the United Arab Emirates for eight days, confirmed Jos√© Ag√ºero, Paraguay's ambassador to the Emirati country.

""The information we have and that we have confirmed, but not yet through official channels, is that Diego Benítez was arrested eight days ago and is in a detention center in Sharjah, an hour and a half from the Emirati capital,"" the diplomat explained. He also indicated that, like any Paraguayan citizen, Benítez has the right to a trial and to receive all necessary assistance. He also noted that they are awaiting the report on the reason for his arrest. If it was because of the Interpol code, the extradition will be carried out, he added, adding that they learned of the arrest of the former sports leader from information provided by the Dubai Police. Diego Benítez was an official of the Guaran√≠ club, but at the end of 2017 the former president of the Olimpia club, Marco Trovato, brought him to work with him as a sports manager and in the following election he joined the Board of Directors as a full member. The Prosecutor's Office accuses him of having carried out, in the months of December 2020 and February 2021, activities aimed at sending to Israel a shipment of 16,174 kilos of alleged cocaine hidden in containers.

3,Prosecutors do not rule out Diego Benítez being prosecuted in the United Arab Emirates,"The Public Prosecutor's Office has not ruled out the possibility that businessman and former sports manager of the Olimpia club, Diego Benítez, will be prosecuted in the United Arab Emirates for an incident related to the possession of false documents. June 13, 2022 09:09 am The prosecutor for International Affairs, Manuel Dold√°n, indicated that it may be a decision of the United Arab Emirates to prosecute businessman Diego Benítez for possession of false documents. The businessman had an original passport from another country, but with false data, according to Dold√°n. He also pointed out that the delay in official communication could even be based on the commission of a crime punishable under the national law of that country. So far, the authorities of the Emirate of Sharjah have not informed Paraguay about the arrest, so an emissary from the Embassy had to be sent. ""We are waiting for the communication, we do not have a specific time to tell you, that in 'x' days they would be sending the official communication, but we are already ahead of the responsibilities that are inherent to the Prosecutor's Office,"" he said, noting that they have already met with Judge Gustavo Amarilla to work on an extradition request. For her part, prosecutor Elva C√°ceres said that Germany had no intention of initially requesting the Paraguayan businessman, given that the investigations against him began after the seizure of some 16 tons of cocaine in the port of Hamburg in that country. However, the agent explained that Germany still has information that it is analyzing regarding Benítez and that it is not sharing it yet. Charges for mega-loads of cocaine The businessman, owner of Pinturas Tupa SA, was charged with possession, trafficking and sale of narcotic substances by the Public Prosecutor's Office, following seizures of mega-loads of cocaine in European ports, amounting to some 23 tons. The Public Prosecutor's Office accuses the businessman of having carried out, in the months of December 2020 and February 2021, activities aimed at sending to Israel a shipment of 16,174 kilos of alleged cocaine, which was hidden in containers.

Diego Benítez is also believed to be responsible for another shipment of seven tons of cocaine that had already been sold in Europe. This second shipment brings the total to 23 tons of the drug that were destined for the Old Continent. North Atlantic Operation The operation known as North Atlantic had begun with the simultaneous raids of companies and a home, as part of an investigation into the seizure of large volumes of cocaine in Hamburg and Belgium. However, it took more than a year for any new progress to be made in the case. Four cattle farms linked to former sports leader Diego Benítez were raided in April and make up the merger known as Estancia Venecia. The site consists of some 7,300 hectares, a luxurious main residence that has artificial lakes, surrounded by reservoirs, an Australian tank and two luxurious buildings with large infrastructure. One of them even has a fully heated and covered swimming pool, a refrigerated chamber, a shed in the service area and a corral for livestock. The place also houses a landing strip with night lighting."

So far, there is no clear information on what procedures will be carried out to seek the extradition of the Paraguayan, since the United Arab Emirates does not have an extradition agreement with Paraguay.

G√ºnter Krone, spokesman for Paraguay's Public Prosecutor's Office, told NPY that a meeting was held in the last few hours between Interpol agents and representatives of Abu Dhabi to coordinate the extradition.

18,Alleged drug trafficker linked to businessman Diego Benítez arrested in Colombia,"Colombian authorities arrested this weekend the alleged Iranian-German drug trafficker Pouya Mohmini, who was being sought for a shipment of 16 tons of cocaine that was seized in Hamburg, Germany, and that left from Paraguay. February 04, 2024 07:59 pm Colombian media outlet El Espectador reports that he is one of the most wanted drug traffickers in Europe and that he had been hiding for some time in the city of Cali, Colombia, under another identity, according to authorities. The man had an Interpol red code and was handed over to Colombian immigration authorities, awaiting deportation to Germany. It is believed that the man was still coordinating the shipment of drugs to Europe from Colombia. The detainee had identification as Reza Raskshan, but was wanted for the crimes of importing and trafficking large quantities of narcotics and arms trafficking. The 16 tons of cocaine seized left Paraguay hidden in paint cans from the company of former sports leader Diego Benítez, who is currently in prison in the United Arab Emirates. The investigation against Diego Benítez in Paraguay indicates that the drugs were placed in the cans inside the former leader's company and not on the way."
19,United Arab Emirates announces that Diego Benitez can be extradited to Paraguay,"Former sports leader Diego Benítez C√°ceres , prosecuted for alleged drug trafficking, can now be extradited to Paraguay to face justice, according to reports from the United Arab Emirates . August 19, 2024 02:49 pm Judicial authorities in the United Arab Emirates have informed Paraguayan justice that Diego Isaac Benítez Ca√±ete may be extradited to the country to face charges of alleged drug trafficking, reported √öltima Hora journalist Ra√∫l Ram√≠rez. Judge Osmar Legal also requested the list of prosecutors who will bring him from the Arab country. The former sports manager of Club Olimpia is wanted by local authorities in connection with the mega shipment of 16 tons of cocaine that was seized on February 12, 2021 in Hamburg, northern Germany. In March 2022, he was charged with possession, trafficking and sale of narcotic substances, and the Paraguayan justice system ordered his international arrest. His whereabouts were unknown until June 2022, when it was learned that he had been detained in the Arab country due to documentation problems. Paraguay began the extradition process, which was confirmed by the UAE on November 20, 2023, but was postponed in December of the same year due to an investigation being opened against him in the United Arab Emirates for alleged minor crimes. According to the Public Prosecutor's Office, the businessman carried out activities in December 2020 and February 2021 aimed at sending a shipment of 16,174 kilos of alleged cocaine to Israel, which was hidden in containers. It is also linked to a 7-ton shipment that has already been sold in Europe. The investigation indicates that Benítez used his company, Pinturas Tupa SA, to send the drugs under the guise of a shipment of fillers for the Israeli company Tambour Group."
20,Prosecutors charge Diego Benítez with money laundering and criminal association,"The Prosecutor's Office has brought charges against former sports leader Diego Benítez, accused of having committed acts of money laundering and criminal association.

Karen Alcira Ortellado, Ver√≥nica Elizabeth Ortellado Talavera and Gabriela Magal√≠ Ortellado Talavera were also charged for the same reasons. ""The factual hypothesis supported by the Public Prosecutor's Office is that the companies Preferente SA, Prominente SA and Pinturas Tupa SA (companies formed by Diego Isaac Benítez and his wife Karen Ortellado Talavera) would have been used to hide or disguise, with the entry into the financial system, money from illicit activities related to the shipment of narcotic substances abroad, in the period between December 13, 2019 and February 2021,"" reads the indictment document. It is also reported that the companies Bonagro SA, Transporte Sky Line SA, Seguridad Skanderberg SA and the real estate company Casa Nossa SA were allegedly established by Diego Benítez, Ver√≥nica Ortellado and Gabriela Ortellado, to conceal the origin of the assets that come from the commission of criminal offences of possession, trafficking and sale of narcotic substances. The accused is currently outside the country, in the United Arab Emirates, and has an international arrest warrant. In August, judicial authorities in the United Arab Emirates informed the local courts that Benítez could be extradited to the country on charges of alleged drug trafficking.

This also affects the defendants' cars. The blocking of the bank and financial accounts of the accused was also requested."
